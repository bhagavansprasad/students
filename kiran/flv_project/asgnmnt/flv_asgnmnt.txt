V1. Building student DB, and parsing
===================================
- This assignment consist of two kinds of activities (Modules).  

	1. Building DB
	2. Parsing DB

- Both modules shares the 'student' structure.
Structure of student record
typedef struct student
{
	char name[124];
	int age;
	int class;
}

1. Building DB
--------------
This module creates a DB file with student(s) records
- Open a student.db file in text mode
- Write few students records into it
- After filling each record, write entire sturucture to db i.e. 132 bytes

Example. 
strcpy(stu.name, "Saketh Ram");
stu.age = 10;
stu.class = 5;
write(fd, &stu, sizeof(student));

2. Parsing DB
--------------
This module is responsible to read the student information for DB file and prints
- Need parse entire DB file and print all the records of the student information

V2. Building student DB with multiple versions, and parsing
==========================================================
- This assignment consist of two kinds of activities (Modules).  

	1. Building DB
	2. Parsing DB

1.Building DB
-------------
- Open a student.db file in text mode
- The first 4 bytes of the file tells you the version of the file.
- If the version number is 1, then the file contains the same information as
  above
- If the version number is 2, then the file contains the student record as bello

	typedef struct student
	{
		char name[124];
		char grade;
		int marks;
		int age;
		int class;
	};

- Information about format is

  * 4 Bytes - version of the file

- Write few students records into it
- After filling each record, write entire sturucture to db 
  * If the version is 2, DB file contains student records like bellow
    128 Bytes - Name
	1 Byte    - grade, 65 - A, 66 - B, 67 - C
	4 Bytes   - marks
	4 Bytes	  - Age
	4 Bytes	  - Class

Parsing DB
----------
- Parser module should read atleast 4 bytes from file inorder to understand the
  version and format of the DB.
- Read and print each student information based on version number
