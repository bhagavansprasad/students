
=====> what is link between storage classes and storage section?

storage classes are :auto, static,extern,register
storage sections are:stack,heap,bss,data,text

auto var are stored in stack and in bss all the unintialised global ,static
local ,static global and in data  all the intialised global ,static
local ,static global and in text strings ,function names 


=====> malloc give the address and by using this we can call free() how that function
       know size of malloc ?
malloc maintains the header it consists the information about malloc what is
the size of malloc



=====> how to find the middle node of the linklist



=====> is there any function having in heap memory ? how types of memory s having in
       our system ?

malloc and calloc and realloc ,there are two types of memory are there in our
system which are static and dynamic memory


=====> what is the output of below program
		#include <stdio.h>
		main()
		{
		char *p = NULL;
		printf("%d\n",*p);
		}

		ans: segmentation fault

=====> what is the output of below program
		#include <stdio.h>
		main()
		{
			int a = 5 ,b = 6;
			int retval = 0;
			retval = fun();
			printf("%d\n",retval);
		}
		int fun()
		{
		printf("%d\n",a);
		printf("%d\n",b);
		return 0;
		}
		
		ans: error a and b not declared

=====> how you can find memory leak?

if we allocate memory using malloc() after completion execution free() will call
but we can't assign value "0" to that pointer at that still the pointer is
pointing that location only this is called memoryleak


=====> if you freeing the memory forceblly if the is runing what happens?

i can change the time snap in that case

=====> how can you find buffer overflow?

i maintain both head and tail it contains very very unique string after
completion i check this string if the string is changed then the buffer overflow
is occured
