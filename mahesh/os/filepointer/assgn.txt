1.Try a program by using statements close(0),close(1),close(2) then what is the
  o/p  of that program?

2.First open 7 different files ...after close 4 th file...now again open another
new file then what is the new fd?

3.First open 7 different files ...after close 4 th file...now use dup(7)
statement then what is the new fd?

4.Open a same "a.c" file in two different processes (p1,p2) then what is the
fd's of two processes & what about the file pointers?

5.Use a open() statement before fork() then what about the file pointer
positions & fd's also (whether it is same or different)?

6.Open a 7 different files in two individual processes then what are the file
discriptors?

7.How to print or move a program output into/in a file?
 hint:use close(1) and dup() statements?

8.Find max number of fd's (files we can open in a process)?

9.Find max number of fd's (files we can open in different process)?
 hint:use a sleep() statement in one of the process

10.Find max number of fd's (system wide limits)?
 hint:use /proc/pid/limits  and cat limits commands
