Fun and Plussure with Pressure (Air and Water)

Experiment I - Moving Object with Compressed AIR 
A hovercraft is a vehicle that travels on a layer of compressed air just above
any kind of land or water surface. The compressed air serves as an invisible
cushion that eliminates almost all friction between the vehicle and the
surfaces.  

Experiment II - Building JCB with Water Pressure
JCB is with model built with water pressure which is directed to right way in
order to achieve specific activities

Experiment III - Impact of whater whirlpool effect Air pressure
This experiment is as simple as that it can be demostrated while emptying water
from bottle.  By creating whirlpool effect water is out of bottle easily
