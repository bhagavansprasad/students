*...Gentle man "You are argumentative, I am suspending you from the event"*

The above 12 years old statement keeps riging in my years very loudly in any of my discussions with any.

My name is Bhagavan Prasad, and I had the privilege of participating in your day-long team-building program 12 years ago. 

Let me start by saying a BIG thank you for your "statement".  It helped me all along my career.

I am reaching out to you with a specific purpose in mind. I am eager to provide the same transformative experience to the next generation, namely six young individuals between the ages of 15 and 25 who are part of my extended family and friends. I firmly believe that exposing them to your sessions at this formative stage will have a profound and positive impact on their personal and professional development.

Observing that these young individuals often underutilize their strengths, I am convinced that a program tailored to their demographic would be invaluable. I anticipate a minimum group size of six participants, though I expect the actual number to exceed this. Additionally, there is interest from parents, including myself, to join the sessions alongside the younger participants.

I kindly request any additional details or requirements from my end to facilitate this arrangement. Regarding tentative dates, we are flexible to be ready with 2 weeks notice.

Thank you for considering this request, and I look forward to your guidance on the next steps.

Jai Hind Sir
