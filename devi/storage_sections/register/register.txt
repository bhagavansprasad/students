A register storage class is very similar to auto storage class except one most
	imp property. All reg var in c Stored in CPU not in m/m.
reg var executes faster than others
we cant dereference reg vaar bcoz since it dont have any m/m address
default value of reg var is garbage
scope and visibility of reg is within blk
we are requesting to store the reg var in CPU, but we are not forcing to store
reg var in CPU.
